  <p>We're dedicated to helping you find the perfect place to stay, regardless of your style, budget, or location. Feel free to browse around and take a look at some of the many currently available spaces for rent. Let us know if we can improve your experience in any way.</p><br>

  <p>This is just a project intended for learning Rails and associated technologies. Feel free to have a look around and test out functionality. Current plans include a functional bookings calendar.</p>
